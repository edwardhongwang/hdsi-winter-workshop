We can implement it with the chain-of-thought prompting technique.\n","* 🛠️ By leveraging their ability to call tools (code or JSON), we can fill the gap in their abilities. We can implement it with a simple react loop, which underlies most agentic frameworks.\n","\n","\n","### ➡️ Next steps ➡️\n","\n","* 💾 More sophisticated memory: in the examples, we simply use the thought, observation, action history as the agent's memory.

But many agentic frameworks allow to have multiple agents.
